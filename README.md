# Clean Soccer
a minimalistic website for soccer highlights

Preview: https://lucasnsaraujo.github.io/Clean-Soccer/

- This website shows soccer matches highlights from around the world, always from the most recent to oldest.
- For now it's only showing the 30 most recent videos.
- I made it mainly to practice how fetch() works on Javascript, to learn how to parse through data and trying to do a responsive website (as much as I know it works on mobile devices as well).
- As you can see I'm not the best at designing stuff lol. But it's made with love.
